Django Simple Multi-Reseller Website with Payment
This is a simple Multi-Reseller e-commerce website built with Django (Python) and Stripe added as the payment processor.

In this website, Resellers (Stores) can register and add their products. Users can visit the products and order them by paying with a Debit/Credit Card (Stripe is used). The Reseller then gets an email notification about the order and should deliver the product to the customer based on the address details.
